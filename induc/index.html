				IIIT-Delhi strives to generate a pool of graduates who not only possess the essential qualities to
				fulfill their responsibility as an engineer, but also as a citizen and a human being. Our  Induction
				Program has been designed with precision to promote academic success, personal and
				social development, and to provide students with information about services and support systems at
				IIIT-Delhi. The primary goal of our Induction Program is to make the new students acquainted and
				connected to the people and resources in the IIITD community. We propel to generate a plethora of
				opportunities and offer experiences to engage the curious minds productively, challenge their
				beliefs, and motivate them to grow intellectually, socially, and emotionally. This 5 days
				fun-packed learning programme encompasses a blend of activities including motivational talks by
				prominent speakers, panel discussions, ice breaking sessions, individual / group manoeuvre, stress
				and time management workshops, ethics and value learning, and much more. To develop a close knit
				social interaction and a sense of belongingness within the environment, activities such as
				 karaoke, talent show, quiz, etc are also planned for our students.
